## About Me

Hey! My name is Michael Canudas, and I am a programmer from New York. I started learning programming when I was just 12 years old, and have been advancing my skills ever since. I currently know c++, typescript, javascript, swift, python, and java. However, I am most advanced in c# and golang. I have experience using different applications/librarys such as Unity, JavaFX, Fiber, React and Svelte. My favorite things to create are games and webapps, however I am always interested in creating other applications as well.

## About Projects

As you will soon find, all of my projects on GitHub have a README with a section titled "Info". In this section, you will find a label "Project Difficulty". This is a rating I give to my projects which explains how difficult it was for me, and what I learned/practiced/mastered. Below, you can find a chart explaining all of the ratings:
